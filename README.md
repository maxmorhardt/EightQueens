# EightQueens
Author: Max Morhardt

This is a program to solve the eight queens problem using a search based A.I. Eight queens is a problem where the goal is to get eight chess queens 
onto a chess board where none of them can attack each other. To solve this I used hill climbing with and without random restarts at local maximum. 
The heuristic is the number of attacks that can be made on different queens.

The program's entry point is in the EightQueen class within the application package.
